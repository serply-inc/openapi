    # Introduction

    An API to perform web searches and gather market data. Get Fast and accurate real time data.

    Simple to use API, but advance enough to support special parameters such as languages, country and geographic locality. Get back JSON formated data.

    Serply is the ultimate search API for developers, marketers, and data sciencitst.

    Here is some of what it can do:
      - **Web Search**: Perform web searchs from `Google` and `Bing` for SEO/SERP data and with advertisment data
      - **News**: Search through thousands of news sources such as CNN, BBC, Reuters.
      - **Products**: Search though thousands of product for the biggest e-commerce (Amazon)

    # Docs

    Serply API [Swagger Specs](https://github.com/serply-inc/openapi/blob/main/serply_openapi.json) can be found at our public [Github Repo](https://github.com/serply-inc). We also have [docs](https://docs.serply.io/api) where you can try out the API and get code examples for various languages such as CURL, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java.

    # Example Code

    Check out our [Serply examples code](https://github.com/serply-inc/example_codes) for example code for calling the API with various languages.

    # Authentication

    ### API Key

    Optional API key for authenticated access. Note that we use "API key" interchangably in these docs.

    Authenticated requests must include an `apikey` header containing your subscription's API Key.

    | Security Schema Type | Header Name | Example Token |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | API Key | `X-Api-Key` | 2505adfbfbmshd20dee55ce912f8p17bd |

    In the following example, `X-Api-Key` represents the auth token for your account.

    ```
    curl --header 'X-Api-Key: YOU_APIKEY'
    ```

    You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](https://app.serply.io/users/sign_in).

    Be sure to keep your API keys secure. Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

    Also note that all API requests must be made over **HTTPS**. Calls made over plain HTTP will attempt to be automatically upgraded to HTTPS, though this use cases is discouraged.

    ## Rate Limits

    API requests may be rate limited depending on your subscription plan and traffic patterns. The following response headers will be present in these cases:

    | Header | Description |
    | ------ | ----------- |
    | `x-ratelimit-requests-limit` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make. |
    | `x-ratelimit-requests-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |

    When the rate limit is **exceeded**, an error is returned with the status "**429 Too Many Requests**":

    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "too_many_requests",
        "message": "Too many requests"
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Errors

    This API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, endpoint not found, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API (these are rare).

                            About Us Come reimagine care with us! We're on a mission to change the way medical care is delivered around the country.

                            By supplying home-based medical care to patients who need it most, WellBe is changing lives by providing care wherever our patients call home. WellBe's primary care services are delivered by a team of licensed clinicians in the comfort of the patient's home. By combining the strength of physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, paramedics, and other healthcare professionals, WellBe delivers an extra level of support to the patients we serve in their communities.

                            This high-risk population is typically underserved and challenged with access to care which we provide. To address these problems, we have elected to bring the care to the patient, instead of trying to bring the patient to the care. WellBe's clinician-led geriatric care teams provide concierge-level medical care and social support in the home as well as delivering and coordinating across the entire care continuum - from chronic care and urgent care in the home to hospital to skilled nursing facility to assisted living to palliative care, to end-of-life care.

                            Joining WellBe means joining a growing, purpose-driven organization to deliver the highest quality care to our senior communities and to make an impact on lives every day.

                            The main project related to this role is a satellite calibration project. We are using ICESat-2 spaceborne lidar photon returns to characterize water-column attenuation properties. Presently we are working at local scales and hope to scale up to regional and even global analyses. Much of the work involves signal processing in conjunction with three PIs and a postdoc working on the project. Some work will involve comparisons of ICESat-2 data to other more traditional remotely sensed data projects. Optional field work may be occasionally involved (weather-dependent).
